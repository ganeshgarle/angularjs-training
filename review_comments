1. All the validation logic is written in factory. This should be avoided. You can keep single service for add/update/delete data. Why two?
   
2. Passing scope as parameter is a very Bad practice. You have passed controller's scope to service. 
   Also, the  scope is not just read, it is manipulating data outside the  controller. BAD. 

3. Functions are to be named as per the work they perform. Saw a function "incomeDetailFunInsideFact". What on earth does that mean?

4. Different views/routes should ideally have unique templates, with unique controllers. You have used same template for different controllers. This has lead to a lot of unnecessary code.
